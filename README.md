**data3p.txt**: The data is used to train the ANN for the control of $3$ spherical particles with $8$ inlets as shown in Fig. 2-4. Starting from the left, the columns represent $$V^1_x/U_c, V^1_y/U_c,r^1_x/R, r^1_y/R,V^2_x/U_c, V^2_y/U_c,r^2_x/R, r^2_y/R,V^3_x/U_c, V^3_y/U_c,$$
$$r^3_x/R, r^3_y/R,U^1/U_c,U^2/U_c,U^3/U_c,U^4/U_c,U^5/U_c,U^6/U_c,U^7/U_c$$,respectively.
                           
**data_ob.txt**: The data is used to train the ANN for the control of $1$ spherical particle with $3$ inlets in the environment with obstacles as shown in Fig. 5. Starting from the left, the columns represent $$V^1_x/U_c, V^1_y/U_c,r^1_x/R, r^1_y/R,U^1/U_c,U^2/U_c$$, respectively.     
                           
**data_prolate.txt**: The data is used to train the ANN for the control of $1$ prolate particle with $4$ inlets in the environment as shown in Fig. 6. tarting from the left, the columns represent $$V^1_x/U_c, V^1_y/U_c, \Omega T_c,r^1_x/R, r^1_y/R,\theta_\tau, U^1/U_c,U^2/U_c,U^3/U_c$$, respectively.
